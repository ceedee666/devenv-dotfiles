# ceedee's dotfiles

## About this repository

This repository contains configuration and customisation settings for Christians workspace, following the [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) philosophy and practice. Most of the content here is based on DJ Adams's [dotfile repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/devenv-dotfiles-qmacro). 

## Requirements

The dotfiles here have been developed on macOS, which is what you'll need to use them. They will most likely work on Linux too.

## Download and installation

To install, clone this repository. I suggest cloning it to your home directory, which is where I keep mine. Be careful not to clobber anything you already have there.

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/SAP-samples/devenv-dotfiles-qmacro .git
git config --unset core.bare
git reset
```
